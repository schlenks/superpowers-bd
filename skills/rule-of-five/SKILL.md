# Rule of Five

Each pass has ONE job. Re-read the entire artifact through that lens. See `references/pass-order-rationale.md` for order rationale and convergence details.

## Quick Start

**Create native tasks for 5 passes with sequential dependencies:**

```
TaskCreate: "Pass 1: Draft"
  description: "Shape and structure. Get the outline right. Breadth over depth."
  activeForm: "Drafting"

TaskCreate: "Pass 2: Correctness"
  description: "Logic, bugs, regressions. Does it work? Did it break anything?"
  activeForm: "Checking correctness"
  addBlockedBy: [draft-task-id]

TaskCreate: "Pass 3: Clarity"
  description: "Comprehension. Can someone unfamiliar understand this? Simplify."
  activeForm: "Improving clarity"
  addBlockedBy: [correctness-task-id]

TaskCreate: "Pass 4: Edge Cases"
  description: "Failure modes. What's missing? What breaks under stress?"
  activeForm: "Handling edge cases"
  addBlockedBy: [clarity-task-id]

TaskCreate: "Pass 5: Excellence"
  description: "Pride. Would you show this to a senior colleague? Polish rough spots."
  activeForm: "Polishing"
  addBlockedBy: [edge-cases-task-id]
```

**ENFORCEMENT:**
- Each pass is blocked until the previous completes
- Cannot commit until all 5 tasks show `status: completed`
- TaskList shows your progress through the passes
- Skipping passes is visible - blocked tasks can't be marked in_progress

For each pass: re-read the full artifact, evaluate through that lens only, make changes, then mark task complete.

## Detection Triggers

Invoke when: >50 lines written/modified, new public API/interface/component, implementation plan/design doc, complex multi-file refactoring, security-sensitive changes, or about to claim "done".

Skip for: Single-line fixes, typo corrections, trivial changes under 20 lines.

Announce: "Applying rule-of-five to [artifact]. Starting 5-pass review."

## The 5 Passes

| Pass | Focus | Exit when... |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Draft** | Shape and structure. Don't perfect - get the outline right. Breadth over depth. | All major components exist |
| **Correctness** | Logic, bugs, regressions. Does it work? Did it break anything? | No known errors; no regressions |
| **Clarity** | Comprehension. Can someone unfamiliar understand this? Simplify. Cut jargon. | A newcomer could follow it |
| **Edge Cases** | Failure modes. What's missing? What breaks under stress? | Unusual inputs handled |
| **Excellence** | Pride. Would you show this to a senior colleague? Polish the rough spots. | You'd sign your name to it |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Multiple lenses in one pass | ONE lens per pass. Correctness pass ignores style. |
| Skipping passes on "simple" artifacts | All 5 or none. Choose a different approach for trivial work. |
| Rushing through passes | Each pass: genuinely re-read the full artifact |
| Pass finds nothing to change | That's fine. Move on. Not every pass surfaces issues. |
| Applying to entire codebase | Artifact = the unit you're changing. A function, component, or document--not the whole system. |
| Ignoring consumers when modifying | Grep for usages. Check if callers depend on specific behavior you're changing. |

## Modifying Existing Code

Shift Correctness pass: **"Did I break anything?"** matters more than "Does my addition work?"

Correctness checklist for modifications:
1. Does my change work correctly?
2. Did I break the code I modified?
3. Did I break tests that depend on old behavior?
4. **Did I break consumers?** (Other code that calls/uses what I changed)

See `references/modification-checklist.md` for interface changes and consumer breakage signs.
