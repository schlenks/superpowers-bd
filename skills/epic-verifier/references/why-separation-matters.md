# Why Separation Matters

Self-verification vs dedicated verifier comparison:

| Aspect | Self-Verification | Dedicated Verifier |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Objectivity | Low (invested) | High (fresh eyes) |
| Thoroughness | Skips "obvious" parts | Systematic |
| Evidence | Claims without checking | Must produce proof |
| Skippability | Easy | Explicit step |

**Remember:** This agent exists because verification was consistently missed. Its purpose: make skipping impossible.
