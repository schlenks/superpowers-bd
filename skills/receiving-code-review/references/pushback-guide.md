# Pushback Guide

When and how to push back on code review feedback, and how to handle being wrong.

## When To Push Back

Push back when:
- Suggestion breaks existing functionality
- Reviewer lacks full context
- Violates YAGNI (unused feature)
- Technically incorrect for this stack
- Legacy/compatibility reasons exist
- Conflicts with your human partner's architectural decisions

## How to Push Back

- Use technical reasoning, not defensiveness
- Ask specific questions
- Reference working tests/code
- Involve your human partner if architectural

**Signal if uncomfortable pushing back out loud:** "Strange things are afoot at the Circle K"

## Gracefully Correcting Your Pushback

If you pushed back and were wrong:
```
YES: "You were right - I checked [X] and it does [Y]. Implementing now."
YES: "Verified this and you're correct. My initial understanding was wrong because [reason]. Fixing."

NO: Long apology
NO: Defending why you pushed back
NO: Over-explaining
```

State the correction factually and move on.
