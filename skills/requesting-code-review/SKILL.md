# Requesting Code Review

Dispatch superpowers:code-reviewer subagent to catch issues before they cascade.

**Core principle:** Review early, review often.

## When to Request Review

**Mandatory:**
- After each task in subagent-driven development
- After completing major feature
- Before merge to main

**Optional but valuable:**
- When stuck (fresh perspective)
- Before refactoring (baseline check)
- After fixing complex bug

## How to Request

**1. Get git SHAs:**
```bash
BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD~1)  # or origin/main
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

**2. Dispatch code-reviewer subagent:**

Use Task tool with superpowers:code-reviewer type, fill template at `code-reviewer.md`

**Placeholders:**
- `{PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS}` - What the code should do (plan file path, bd show output, or spec)
- `{BASE_SHA}` - Starting commit
- `{HEAD_SHA}` - Ending commit

**3. Act on feedback:**
- Fix Critical issues immediately
- Fix Important issues before proceeding
- Note Minor issues for later
- Push back if reviewer is wrong (with reasoning)

## Multi-Review Mode

For critical changes, dispatch N=3 independent reviews and aggregate findings. This catches rare bugs that a single reviewer misses (118% recall improvement per SWR-Bench research).

**When to use manually:**
- Changes >200 lines
- Security-sensitive code
- Pre-merge to main
- Complex refactoring

**How:** Dispatch 3 independent code-reviewer subagents with `run_in_background: true`, each with the same template plus `"You are Reviewer {i} of 3. Review independently."` Then aggregate per `superpowers:multi-review-aggregation`.

Single review remains the default for ad-hoc manual requests. Multi-review is automatic in SDD for max-20x and max-5x tiers.

## Example

```
[Just completed Task 2: Add verification function]

You: Let me request code review before proceeding.

BASE_SHA=$(git log --oneline | grep "Task 1" | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

[Dispatch superpowers:code-reviewer subagent]
  PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS: Task 2 from docs/plans/deployment-plan.md
  BASE_SHA: a7981ec
  HEAD_SHA: 3df7661

[Subagent returns]:
  Changed Files Manifest: 3 files, all read in full
  Requirement Mapping: 4/4 requirements implemented
  Not Checked: Did not run tests
  Findings:
    Important: Missing progress indicators (indexer.ts:130)
  Assessment: Ready to merge: With fixes

You: [Fix progress indicators]
[Continue to Task 3]
```

## Integration with Workflows

**Subagent-Driven Development:**
- Review after EACH task
- Catch issues before they compound
- Fix before moving to next task

**Executing Plans:**
- Review after each batch (3 tasks)
- Get feedback, apply, continue

**Ad-Hoc Development:**
- Review before merge
- Review when stuck

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Skip review because "it's simple"
- Ignore Critical issues
- Proceed with unfixed Important issues
- Argue with valid technical feedback

**If reviewer wrong:**
- Push back with technical reasoning
- Show code/tests that prove it works
- Request clarification
