# Agent Prompt Example

## Full Detailed Prompt

Good agent prompts are:
1. **Focused** - One clear problem domain
2. **Self-contained** - All context needed to understand the problem
3. **Specific about output** - What should the agent return?

### Example: Fixing Test Failures

```markdown
Fix the 3 failing tests in src/agents/agent-tool-abort.test.ts:

1. "should abort tool with partial output capture" - expects 'interrupted at' in message
2. "should handle mixed completed and aborted tools" - fast tool aborted instead of completed
3. "should properly track pendingToolCount" - expects 3 results but gets 0

These are timing/race condition issues. Your task:

1. Read the test file and understand what each test verifies
2. Identify root cause - timing issues or actual bugs?
3. Fix by:
   - Replacing arbitrary timeouts with event-based waiting
   - Fixing bugs in abort implementation if found
   - Adjusting test expectations if testing changed behavior

Do NOT just increase timeouts - find the real issue.

Return: Summary of what you found and what you fixed.
```

### Why This Works

- **Test names listed explicitly** - agent knows exactly which tests to focus on
- **Error descriptions included** - agent understands the symptoms
- **Root cause hint provided** - "timing/race condition" narrows investigation
- **Constraints are clear** - "Do NOT just increase timeouts"
- **Output format specified** - "Summary of what you found and what you fixed"
