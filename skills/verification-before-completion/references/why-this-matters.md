# Why Verification Matters

From 24 failure memories:
- your human partner said "I don't believe you" - trust broken
- Undefined functions shipped - would crash
- Missing requirements shipped - incomplete features
- Time wasted on false completion -> redirect -> rework
- Violates: "Honesty is a core value. If you lie, you'll be replaced."
